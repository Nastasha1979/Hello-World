# Hello-World
First use of gitHub-Hellow World Project
//This is my first use of gitHub

My name is Nastasha Leach.
I am 30 years old and recently started learning C++. I just finished my first class and was able to successfully complete all of the assignments and received an A in the class.
I think that I might have a bit of a talent for this. We will see. There are some areas that I had a hard time with. First, was passing arrays into a function.
For some reason I keep mixing up what information needs to be passed. Will need to practice it some more.
Anyway, I am working on learning gitHub. I worked a bit with the command line earlier and downloaded git, but am still a little unssure of the structure of it.
